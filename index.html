            <h2>Introduction: </h2>
            <p>
              Over the past decade shootings have only increased. This has become a
              very big issue in the United States, and has had a profound impact on
              many individuals and the country as a whole. There are many different
              opinions on what a proper solution is, such as banning guns completelty,
              investing into more extensive background checks, or putting more focus
              on mental health. While a solution is being argued over, shootings still
              occur regularly with no change. In this project I am not seeking a
              solution, but instead seeking to find valuable insights and trends
              regarding what qualities are common among most active shooters, race,
              genger, mental health, etc. This data will assist in finding a solution
              because it provides valuable information about what exactly “makes” an
              active shooter. Knowing this can help pinpoint which direction a
              possible solution to this issue should point.
