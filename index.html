        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>
          Over the past decade shootings have only increased. This has become a
          very big issue in the United States, and has had a profound impact on
          many individuals and the country as a whole. There are many different
          opinions on what a proper solution is, such as banning guns
          completelty, investing into more extensive background checks, or
          putting more focus on mental health. While a solution is being argued
          over, shootings still occur regularly with no change. In this project
          I am not seeking a solution, but instead seeking to find valuable
          insights and trends regarding what qualities are common among most
          active shooters, race, genger, mental health, etc. This data will
          assist in finding a solution because it provides valuable information
          about what exactly “makes” an active shooter. Knowing this can help
          pinpoint which direction a possible solution to this issue should
          point.

        <h2>Data Curation:</h2>
        <p>
          We will be using <b>Google Colab</b> for this tutorial. It is provides
          use with free acces to computing resources that are well suited for
          data science and machine learning. Follow
          <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="”_blank”"
            >this</a
          >
          link to learn more about the service if you don't, or to get a feel
          for the UI and tools before continuing. Once you've done that create a
          new Colab and name it whatever you'd like.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are all the imports we will be using in this tutorial, add them
          to your Colab and run the cell:

        <h3>Gathering Data:</h3>
        <p>
          First we need to gather data shootings in the United States. This data
          needs to contain a decent amount of information about the shooting as
          well as the shooter so that we can have more data to work with later
          on. I was able to find pretty good data set on Kaggle that contains
          data on US shootings for the past 50 years. Follow
          <a
            target="”_blank”"
            href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/us-mass-shootings-last-50-years/data"
            >this</a
          >
          link to download the data and add it to your Colab. We specifically
          only want Dataset Ver 5, so only include that one.
        </p>
        <p>
          After you've done that we need to run the following in order to create
          a dataframe with our csv file:
        </p>
        <b>CODE HERE</b>
        <p>
          If you run <b>CODE HERE</b> your data frame should look like this:
        </p>
        <b>CODE HERE</b>
        <p>
          There are many columns that we don't need or want because they don't
          have enough entries or because they aren't useful to us. Execute the
          following in order to get rid of them:
        </p>
        <b>CODE HERE</b>
        <p>
          Now we need to edit some of our columns because the data in them isn't
          properly formatted. The "location" column includes the city, which we
          don't really care for, so we need remove it, and the "target" and
          "cause" columns vary too much in their categories so we need to
          condense them into more broad categories.
        </p>
        <p>In order to do this I have created the following three functions:</p>
        <b>CODE HERE</b>
        <p>
          Add these functions to your collab and run the following in order to
          fix the columns:
        </p>
        <b>CODE HERE</b>
        <p>
          There are some more issues with "Location" column that we need to fix.
          We've gotten rid of the city, but the state is inconsistent. Sometimes
          it is abbreviated, and sometimes it is not. We need this to be
          consistent, so we are going to replace the abbreviations.
        </p>
        <p>In order to do this, use the following dictionary:</p>
        <b>CODE HERE</b>
        <p>And run this:</p>
        <b>CODE HERE</b>
        <p>Now as a final touch we will rename the "Total victims" column:</p>
        <b>CODE HERE</b>
